Software engineer with a proven ability to adapt in both self-starting and
collaborative environments while staying focused on achieving highquality
results under strict deadlines. This quality and results-based
approach drove me to collaborate with the VP of sales at Squarespace to
create a digital marketing campaign that tripled average signups in a
single month. Eager to obtain a challenging position at a prestigious
company like Dream Version that will expand my learning and build upon
                my developer skills.
